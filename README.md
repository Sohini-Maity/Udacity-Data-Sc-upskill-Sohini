Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Project

This is the repo of the Write a Data Science Blog Post project for the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Project.

1- Business Understanding

We investigated the Seattle AirBnB data to get insight how business is doing in diff type of properties, what kind of properties are popular and what time demand is high so that accordingly business can be expanded.


For this, we asked these questions:

- How much business happening on Accessible Vs Non Accessible Property?
- What kind of less pricey properties users are preferring?
- Which time of the year demand is high?
2- Data Understanding

The data comes from the Kaggle Seattle Airbnb Open Data.  three types of data listings, reviews and calendar.Listings, including full descriptions and average review score
Reviews, including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments
Calendar, including listing id and the price and availability for that day. It contains data that comes as numerical, categorical and text. It has missing values and outliers as well.

3- Prepare Data

For the data preparation phase, we gathered the data, assessed it and then proceeded to clean it, focusing on our columns of interest, with python libraries of Numpy and Pandas

4- Data Modeling

we graphed different behaviours that were relevant to the 3 questions, with the python libraries matplotlib and seaborn.

5- Evaluate the Results

for the 3 questions, we arrived at the following conclusions:

- How much business happening on Accessible Vs Non Accessible Property? Non Accessible seems a bit better that Accessible but number of properties are less for Accessible.

- What kind of less pricey properties users are preferring? Apartment Type

- Which time of the year demand is high? January

The readme format:

- libraries used: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn

- The files in the repository with a small description of each: Zip files that are used as the dataset. Also, the Code file is the jupyter notebook script. a summary of the results have pictorial representation.
